# Rasmus Bergh√§ll

I'm a PLC programmer who is now diving into the world of AI and ML. With a solid foundation in the automotive industry, I've honed my skills in PLC programming and automation over the years. I believe that these two fields will increasingly converge in the coming years, creating multiple opportunities for collaboration between the occupations.

When I'm free from work and studying I spend most of my time on the golf course and hanging out with friends. :golf:
